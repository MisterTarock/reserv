#Application Reservation
This is the repo for our work on Techno web course.

The idea was to use the **MVC** Design pattern in order to make a web application
with a *controller*, a *model* and some *views*.

- The **Controller** is the main program that have to make the interaction between
the view, set the session, protect the code, etc.
- The **Model** is the script where the data from the user will be save
- The **Views** are the different pages that are display on the website
